# JavaScript Bootcamp Exercises

Here you can find exercises from a JavaScript bootcamp. These
exercises are beginner-friendly and for everybody who started coding with
JavaScript.

## Exercises

### [Basic JavaScript][1]

Here you have to solve three basic JavaScript tasks containing arrays, strings
and a regular expression.

### [Games Store][2]

Here you have to build a game store consisting of a class with some methods
for user interactions.

### [Ice Cream Parlor][3]

Here you have to build an ice cream parlor. Similar to the game store exercise
but a little bit harder.

### [Taxes][4]

Here you have to calculate taxes for different goods in a medieval era. This one
is a lot of fun and my personal favourite.
