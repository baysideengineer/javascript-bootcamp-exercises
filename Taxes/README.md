# Taxes

This is an exercise from a JavaScript bootcamp back in 2020. You have to calculate taxes for different goods in a medieval era. You will work with `functions` as well with `class`. If you never worked with `class` before, try out the [w3schools class tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_class_intro.asp). After that you should be able to solve this exercise.

## How to work with this exercise

- your complete exercise is inside the `Taxes` folder
- the `lib` folder is for the testing framework [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io) and you can ignore them
- inside the `solution` folder you'll find a solution that covers all test cases
- inside the `spec` folder is the test file
  - if you get stuck, have a look at the `taxes.spec.js` file to understand better what is expected
- in `taxes.js` you'll write all your code for this challenge
- you can start the `index.html` in your browser and see the test cases
  - after you pass a test the site updates and will show your progress
- inside `INSTRUCTIONS.md` you'll find the actual exercise that needs to be solved
  - make sure to write method names, parameter and so on exactly like described
